  <h3>Our Networks</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-7">
    <p>We can source the best developers through our myriad of networks:
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h6>Our Networks</h6>
        <ul class="good">
        <li>meetups</li>
        <li>conferences</li>
        <li>closed alumni networks</li>
        <li>social networking sites</li>
        <li>previous companies</li>
        <li>open source collaboration tools</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h6>Typical Recruitment Tools</h6>
        <ul class="bad">
        <li>spam your email</li>
        <li>call you nonstop</li>
        <li>post on indeed, monster, other sites which anyone could do</li>
        <li>add and endorse you on linkedin</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The industry standard is to forward the results to you, and take half the developers pay to reinvest in more spam. And sure, this works. Even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while. A stopped clock is right twice a day. But what if there were a better way?</p>

  <h3>Our Interview Process</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>We've been through a million interviews, and we know what works and what doesn't typically, it goes something like this:
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>However, we are able to able to provide a process inconceivable by other firms:
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <ul class="bad">
        <li>one word questions you could easily google</li>
        <li>vague, open to interpretation questions, with a simplistic, one dimensional answer expected,
          that the recruiter does not know enough to deviate from</li>
        <li>checking off a list of buzzwords which may or may not be relevant</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <ul class="good">
        <li>background research (social media, open source projects, etc.)</li>
        <li>open, conversational interview</li>
        <li>in-depth technical interview</li>
        <li>group discussion on findings</li>
        <li>detailed report with recommendation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>



  <p>Only we can provide an adequate, coherent screening throughout this 5 step process, because we know the technology and industry and what to look for.</p>

  <h2>Our Commitment</h2>

  <p>Up to this point, we can imagine the reader vexed, because up to this point we have sounded like a group of developers with no business sense, but that is not true. Two of our group have business degrees, two have started their own startups as C*Os, we have an angel investor, most have owned their own business, and in general a really smart, talented group of people</p>

  <p>But our commitment doesn't stop at the provision of good developers. We strive to provide every ounce of professionalism and courtesy you are accustomed to at a typical recruiting firm.</p>

  <p>We are here to provide a service and compete on every level with typical recruitment firms. We expect to have all the requirements for a typical subcontractor in place by the end of the year:

  <ul class="benefits">
  <li>$1.4 million in revenues for 2016</li>
  <li>Membership Small Business Association</li>
  <li>Registration with HubZone</li>
  <li>Registration with Sam.gov</li>
  <li>Registration with National Minority Supplier Development Council</li>
  <li>Liquid funds for major business expenses</li>
  <li>Attorneys, accountants, and other professionals in place</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Overall, when you receive a prospective hire from Mastery Division, you will know you are getting the best. We will (and can) discern the wheat from the chaff with our own expertise, and we are dedicated to providing the best service possible to our customers.</p>
